                        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                            <p>S-Stock is a photo discovery platform , high-definition photos. The following is a legal agreement between you ("you" or "User/s") and the owners and operators ("we", "us", or "S-Stock") of the site at s-stock.com (the "Website") and all related websites, software, mobile apps, plug-ins and other services that we provide (together, the "Service"). Your use of the Service, and our provision of the Service to you, constitutes an agreement by you and S-Stock to be bound by the terms and conditions in these Terms of Service ("Terms").</p>
                            <p>"Content" shall refer collectively to all Images and ,EPS files uploaded to S-Stock and made available under the S-Stock License. "Image/s" includes photographs, vectors, drawings, and illustrations. "Video" refers to any moving images, animations, films, or other audio/visual representations.</p>
                            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change or modify portions of these Terms at any time. If we do this, we will post the changes on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the date these Terms were last revised. Any such changes will become effective immediately. Your continued use of the Service after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
                        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
                            <p>The Service is designed for use by people who are at least 13 years old. If you are not yet 13, then you can’t use the Service. If you are 13 or older, you promise to us that you have never been suspended from the Service, and promise that your use of the Service won’t break any laws or regulations. If you are using the Service on behalf of a company, organization, or other kind of entity, you represent to us that you have authority to bind the organization to these Terms on its behalf.</p>
                        <h2>3. Accounts and Registration</h2>
                            <p>When you use the Service, you have the opportunity to register an account. We suggest you do register an account, because creating an account on the Service gives you access to special features around discovery and downloading to the community. If you do, we ask that you give us some information about yourself as part of the registration process, some of which is required in order to register the account. You promise that all the information you provide is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up-to-date in the future. We also ask you to provide a password to protect the security of your account. You are responsible for keeping your password safe and confidential. Any activity that happens under your account will be your responsibility. If ever you think that your account may no longer be secure, you need to notify us immediately at help@sstock.com.</p>
                        <h2>4. License to Photos</h2>
                            <p>One of the best features of the Service permits you to search, view, and download photographs that have been uploaded by S-Stock  users (“Photos”). You may download and use Photos from the Service in accordance with, and subject to, the S-Stock License.</p>
                            <p>S-Stock grants you an irrevocable, nonexclusive, worldwide copyright license to download, copy, modify, distribute, perform, and use photos from S-Stock, including for commercial purposes, without permission from or attributing the photographer or S-Stock, but this license does not include the right to compile photos from S-Stock to replicate a similar or competing service.</p>
                            <p>This means that Photos on the Service come with a very, very broad copyright license under the S-Stock License. This is why we say that they are “Free to Use.” Note that the S-Stock License does not include the right to use:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Trademarks, logos, or brands that appear in Photos</li>
                                <li>People’s images if they are recognizable in the Photos</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If you download photos with any of these depicted in them, you may need the permission of the brand owner of the brand or work of authorship or individual depending on how you use the Photo. If you still aren’t sure, you should probably talk to a lawyer who knows about these things.</p>
                        <h2>5. Digital Millenium Copyright Act</h2>
                            <p>We comply with the parts of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that are applicable to internet service providers (17 U.S.C. §512, as amended). If you think that materials uploaded to or posted on the Service infringe any of your copyrights, you may contact our Designated Agent at:</p>
                            <p>S-Stock mail: abuse@sstock.com</p>
                            <p>Any notice that alleges materials hosted by or distributed through the Service infringe intellectual property rights must include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other right that is alleged to be infringed;</li>
                                <li>a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed;</li>
                                <li>a description of the material that you claim is infringing and where it is located on the Service; your address, telephone number, and email address;</li>
                                <li>a statement from you that you have a good faith belief that the use of the materials on the Service of which you are complaining is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</li>
                                <li>a statement by you that the information in your notice is accurate and that, under penalty of perjury, you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner's behalf.</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>We will terminate (without notice) the accounts of users that we find are “repeat infringers,” which is a user who has been notified of infringing activity more than twice or has had infringing User Content removed from the Service more than twice.</p>
                        <h2>6. Other Companies' Services and Linked Websites</h2>
                            <p>You may find tools on the Service that let you send information, including User Content, to other companies’ services, such as through features that allow you to link your account on the Service with an account on another service (e.g., Twitter or Facebook or the implementation of other companies’ like or share buttons). If you use these tools, you permit us to send this information to the other companies’ services and you acknowledge that we are not responsible for the other companies’ use of this information because, well, we don’t control them at all. You may also find links to other websites not operated by us on the Service. These websites are also not under our control, so please use your discretion when you leave the Service.</p>
                        <h2>7. Termination of Your Account</h2>
                            <p>If you breach any of these Terms, your permission to use the Service will terminate automatically.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, we may terminate your account on the Service or suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time (with or without notice) without liability to you.</p>
                            <p>We may update, modify, or even discontinue the Service at any time without notice to you.</p>
